Privacy-preserving AI for mental disease detection

We are trying to build an end-to-end encrypted deep learning pipeline for mental health disease detection using private patient data. 

Technologies used so far:
  1. PyTorch
  2. [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) - for federated learning
  3. [diffprivlib](https://github.com/IBM/differential-privacy-library) - for differential privacy
  4. Quail - for synthetic data generation with noise
